# Production Readiness Plan - SMCCCD Site Index

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines all critical issues that must be resolved before deploying to production. The application is currently experiencing multiple UI/UX issues and broken functionality that would severely impact user experience.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. Data Management & Backup (CRITICAL)
- **Backups page completely broken** - Returns "Failed to fetch backups" error
- Export functionality returns empty JSON files
- Import functionality untested
- **Risk**: Data loss, inability to recover from failures

### 2. Admin Dashboard Pages - Multiple Failures
All of the following pages fail to load with fetch errors:
- Performance Monitoring (`/admin/tools/performance`)
- Cache Manager (`/admin/tools/cache`)
- Usage Analytics (`/admin/analytics/usage`)
- Search Insights (`/admin/analytics/search`)
- System Settings (`/admin/system/settings`)

### 3. UI/UX Functionality Issues
- **Command Palette** (Cmd+K) - Completely non-functional, cannot type in search box
- **Bulk Operations** - Feature exists but doesn't work
- **Dashboard Metrics** - Showing placeholder data (should display "N/A" when no data)

### 4. Responsive Design Issues
- Content overflowing containers on smaller resolutions
- Browse Items table extends beyond viewport
- API Explorer layout issues (needs vertical layout instead of horizontal)

## Prioritized Fix Order

### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **Fix Backup System** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - Debug and fix backup fetch endpoint
   - Ensure export generates valid JSON/CSV
   - Test import functionality
   - Add error recovery mechanisms

2. **Fix All Admin Page Errors**
   - Debug API routes for each failing page
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add loading states and retry mechanisms
   - Ensure data fetching works correctly

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 1-2)
3. **Command Palette/Search**
   - Fix keyboard event handling
   - Implement search functionality
   - Add keyboard shortcuts

4. **Data Import/Export**
   - Fix JSON export to include actual data
   - Test and verify import functionality
   - Add validation and error handling

5. **Bulk Operations**
   - Implement actual bulk functionality
   - Add progress indicators
   - Include undo/confirmation dialogs

### Phase 3: UI/UX Polish (Week 2)
6. **Responsive Design**
   - Fix table overflow issues
   - Implement proper mobile layouts
   - Test on various screen sizes

7. **Dashboard Improvements**
   - Replace placeholder values with "N/A" or actual data
   - Verify all metrics are accurate
   - Add proper loading states

8. **API Explorer Layout**
   - Redesign to vertical layout
   - Improve readability of responses
   - Add syntax highlighting

### Phase 4: ADA Compliance & Testing (Week 2-3)
9. **Accessibility Audit**
   - Keyboard navigation for all features
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - ARIA labels and roles
   - Color contrast verification

10. **Comprehensive Testing**
    - Fix all TypeScript errors
    - Update E2E tests for all workflows
    - Performance testing
    - Security audit

## Technical Debt Items
- Review and optimize database queries
- Implement proper caching strategy
- Add comprehensive error logging
- Set up monitoring and alerting

## Security Critical Issues (MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY)

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Exposed Credentials
- **`.env` file is committed to repository with all secrets**
- **Action Required**: Remove from git history, rotate ALL credentials, add to .gitignore

### High Priority Security Fixes
1. **CSRF Protection** - Current implementation incomplete
2. **Security Headers** - Missing CSP, HSTS, X-XSS-Protection
3. **CORS Configuration** - Currently allows all origins (*)
4. **Input Validation** - Not using Zod despite having it installed
5. **Session Management** - No timeout configuration

## Requirements Summary
- **ADA Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA + Section 508 (US Government requirement)
- **Production API**: https://site-index.smccd.edu/api/indexItems?letter=A&campus=...
- **Performance**: Best effort (<100ms cached, <300ms uncached)
- **Security**: OneLogin SSO + best practices implementation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All admin pages load without errors
- [ ] All CRUD operations work correctly
- [ ] Responsive design works on all devices
- [ ] Meets WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Zero console errors
- [ ] Performance metrics meet requirements
- [ ] Security audit passed

## Estimated Timeline
- Week 1: Critical infrastructure and core functionality
- Week 2: UI/UX polish and accessibility
- Week 3: Testing, performance optimization, and final verification

## Next Steps
1. Start with fixing the backup system (CRITICAL)
2. Debug and fix all failing API endpoints
3. Run build and type checks to establish baseline
4. Begin systematic fixes based on priority
